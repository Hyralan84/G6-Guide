**G6 (Endgame) Guide**<br>
**Updated: 7 October 2024.**

- **General Advice**
  - **Optimal Timing**
    - Now is an excellent time to advance to G6 due to increased efficiencies and available primes.
  - **Spending Focus**
    - Prioritize spending on primes and efficiency research over materials and resources.
    - Use multiphasic packs wisely; they now include z-rss, offering better value after reaching level 61.

- **Research and Efficiency**
  - **Efficiency Research**
    - Invest in all efficiency research to reduce long-term costs.
    - Focus on hazard research as soon as possible to access and survive in hazard systems.
  - **Speed Primes**
    - The **500% Build Speed Prime** is highly recommended for faster construction.
    - Consider investing in construction and research speed primes for overall efficiency.

- **Mining and Ships**
  - **Selkie Miner**
    - **Priority Purchase**: Get the Selkie miner before upgrading G5 miners when heading toward G6.
    - **Advantages**
      - Survives in hazard systems where other ships cannot.
      - Mines up to **1000% faster** than G5 miners.
    - **Essential Research**
      - **Adapting Skin**: Critical for effective hazard system mining.
    - **Hazard Mining Dailies**
      - Enables completion of hazard mining daily missions.
  - **G5 Miners**
    - Require:
      - **Tier 8** to mine in G6 space.
      - **Tier 9** to reach the first silent space.
      - **Tier 10** to reach the second silent space.
    - Less efficient compared to the Selkie in G6 mining.
  - **Monaveen Ship Skin**
    - **Must-Have**: Significantly boosts mining capabilities.
  - **Prime Hazard Conditioning**
    - **Nice-to-Have**: Enhances performance in hazard systems.
  - **Mining Sigma Resources**
    - **Not Worthwhile** to mine directly due to low yields (approx. 14k sigma steel twice a day).
    - **Alternative Sources**: Rely on Monaveen, MU refinery, and daily rewards.
    - **Accumulated Gains**: Can collect 300-400k sigma steel per day from various sources.
   
- - **Progression Strategy**
  - **Level Advancement**
    - **Push to Level 61**: Acquire as much hazard-related research as possible.
    - **Advance to Level 63**: Once you have 10 million faction credits to buy the G6 uncommon ship.
  - **Multiphasic Rewards**
    - Significant increases in multiphasic payouts and chest rewards occur at level 63 or 64.
  - **Using Maxed G5 Epics**
    - With good research, maxed G5 epics can complete some dailies.
    - **Disco Primes**: Required to extend their range into hazard systems.

- **Crew Recommendations**
  - **Grinding Crews**
    - **Pike/Marlena Moreau/Synergy** (PM/Spike)
    - **SNW James Kirk/Sam Kirk/SNW Synergy**

- **Resource Management**
  - **Z-RSS Trade-In**
    - Generally unfavorable; most players avoid it unless heavily invested in G5 miners.
  - **Token Trade-Ins**
    - Regularly trade in accumulated tokens from various sources.
    - Becomes more important as you accumulate more resources at higher levels.
  - **Sigma Resources**
    - Utilize various sources to collect sigma resources instead of direct mining.

- **Purchasing Strategy**
  - **Primes and Skins Over Consumables**
    - Focus on long-term efficiency gains by purchasing primes and ship skins.
    - Limit spending on consumable packs unless necessary.
  - **Primes to Consider**
    - **Veen Skin**: Extremely important for mining efficiency.
    - **Prime Hazard Conditioning**: Beneficial for hazard system operations.

- **Additional Tips**
  - **Use of Officers**
    - **Lorca**: Important for efficiency boosts.
  - **Mining Locations**
    - Keep G5 miners in silent space when possible for a 5x mining rate boost.
    - Equip miners with appropriate mining bonuses (e.g., Fortune Tokens).
  - **Game Updates**
    - Take advantage of new additions like sigma tokens in multiphasic packs for resource boosts.

- **Community Support**
  - **Experienced Players**
    - Players like Genie, AF, and Taz are available for advice and strategy sharing.
  - **Progression Easier Over Time**
    - New efficiencies and updates make the path to G6 smoother for newer players.
